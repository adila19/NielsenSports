NOTE 1: This is a small dummy automation project which has pseudo-codes, so it will not run

NOTE 2: I covered only a few portion of scenarios from the task

NOTE 3: Ideally the real environment project should have other libraries like JDBC (to automate DB connection), Apache POI(to interract with excel files), Commons IO, 
libraries for backend like RESTAssured, Jackson DataBind and others depending on the project 

It's a Maven project and all the libraries necessary to run the project are in the POM xml. I used Cucumber as BDD and Selenium for automation of the UI. 
The scripting language I used is Java.
